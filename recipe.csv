8,Sweet and Sour Pork,"MARINADE PORK:
Mix Pork with Marinade. Marinade 18 to 24 hours. (See Note 1 for marinating time for other cuts)
PREPARATION:
Rack & warm oven: Preheat oven to 80°C-175°F and place rack on tray - to keep pork warm.
Sauce: Place all Sauce ingredients EXCEPT water in a large jug or small bowl. Mix until combined, then mix in water.
Be Stir Fry Ready: Have all ingredients lined up, ready to toss in. After Fry #2, things move quickly.
DOUBLE DREDGE:
Coating #1: Mix 5 tablespoons cornflour into the pork and leave for 5 minutes. At first, it will be white from the cornflour, but after a while it will sweat and make the cornflour ( partially) wet, and will be sticky (this is key for coating to stick).
Coating #2: Spread 0.5 cup cornflour in a shallow bowl. Coat pork, shaking off excess, and pile onto a plate.
Reserve cornflour in case you need to dust again just prior to frying. Pork should be at least half white when you put it into the oil (if not, just sprinkle with reserved cornflour).
FRIED CRISPY PORK (NOTE 6 FOR OVEN):
Heat oil: Pour enough oil into a large saucepan or small pot so it's 2.5cm ( 1"") deep. Heat to 180°C-350°F (or until pork immediately starts sizzling when you dip it in).
Fry #1: Cook pork in batches, being sure not to crowd the pot, for 3 minutes until golden. Drain on rack. This step is just to cook the pork. It takes me 4 batches.
Fry #2: Turn the stove up slightly and heat oil to 200°C-390°F. Starting with the coolest pork, add half the pork (you can crowd the pot) and cook for 1.5 minutes, or until pork is deep golden brown and crispy. Transfer to rack, repeat with remaining pork - I do 2 batches.
Keep warm in oven.
SAUCE & STIR FRY:
Heat oil in a very large skillet over high heat.
Add garlic, ginger and onion, stir for 1.5 minutes. Add capsicum and stir for 2 minutes.
Add Sauce & pinapple, then let it come to a rapid simmer. Simmer for 2 minutes until it thickens - when you drag the spoon across the base, a path should briefly appear (see video at 1 min 53 s).
10 second toss: Add pork, then QUICKLY toss to coat - aim for 10 seconds!

13,Baby Bok-Choy with Black Mushroom,"Place the dried Chinese mushrooms into a medium bowl, and pour 2-3 cups of hot water over them. Place a plate over the bowl so the mushrooms are completely submerged. Because the mushrooms are small, they should reconstitute quickly. After 15 minutes, cut off the stems of the mushrooms and return them to the water to soak for another 15 minutes.
Wash your cut Shanghai bok choy in a large bowl of water so the vegetables are fully submerged. Agitating or stirring the vegetables in the water will release any dirt or sand. Repeat this process another 2 times or as necessary, until the water is clean and there is no sand or dirt at the bottom of the bowl.
After your mushrooms are done soaking, transfer to a plate and gently squeeze out the excess water. Set the mushrooms and the soaking water aside.
Bring 6 cups of water, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil. Blanch the Shanghai bok choy for 40 seconds, stirring occasionally. They should be just wilted and bright green. Scoop out the bok choy into a bowl and pour 2 cups of cool water over them. The water will stop the cooking process, but you don’t want your veggies to be ice cold, so pour the bok choy into a colander right after they’ve been submerged in the cool water. Drain.
Next, arrange the bok choy into a circle around a large serving plate, with a space in the middle for the mushrooms.
Now, heat your wok over medium high heat. Spread 10.5 tablespoons vegetable oil around the perimeter. Add the finely minced garlic and mushrooms, and stir fry for 10 seconds. Stir in the Shaoxing wine.
Next, carefully pour the mushroom soaking water into the wok, making sure that you don’t pour any sediment from the bowl into the wok.
While the liquid comes up to a simmer, add 0.25 teaspoon dark soy sauce, 10.5 tablespoons regular soy sauce, 1 tablespoon oyster sauce or vegetarian oyster sauce, 10.5 teaspoons sugar, ? teaspoon sesame oil, and ? teaspoon white pepper. Stir until combined, and turn the heat down to simmer for 5 minutes.
Next, mix the cornstarch slurry and slowly pour it into the sauce while stirring constantly. After letting the mushrooms cook for an additional minute, taste the sauce. If needed, re-season with more soy sauce, sugar, or oyster sauce to your own preference. Add more hot water if the sauce is too thick or more cornstarch slurry if the sauce is too thin.
